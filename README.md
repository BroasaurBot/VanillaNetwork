# VanillaNetwork
## A C++ implementation of a multi-layer perceptron

###Description:
[VanillaNetwork](VanillaNetwork.hpp) reads in from DataManger

![General Description of a multi-layer perception neural network](https://www.dtreg.com/uploaded/pageimg/MLFNwithWeights.jpg)

With 3 layers and including a hidden layer with the size of 20 as capable to achieve 90% accuracy on the MNIST handwritten digit database. Load this neural network with networkReader::readNetwork(&_neuralNet_, "SavedNetworks/90.bin", _dataManager_);

This project was built of the C++ Standard library, and requires no external packages. Theory behind network was devised from author '3Blue1Brown', link to his content: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi
